# Massaged Mirrors
An art project that uses different technologies to manipulate a user's webcam video.

_Massaged Mirrors_ reflects on how our self-image is mediated through digital technologies. The title is a play on the intentionally mispelled title of Marshall McLuhan's seminal book.

Humans are very fascinated by our own likeness; one of the earliest documentation being the Greek myth of Narcissus.

The project utilizes the underlying technologies used by everyday software and popular apps to consider how they shape our perception.
